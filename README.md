Projects from the "Ruby on the Web" module onward for the Ruby Programming course on the Odin Project

## Project 1: Twitter Spambot
### Spec
Create a command-line twitter client using JumpStartLabs' Twitter library to authorize with Twitter's API and send tweets and direct messages. Add functionality to spam all friends with a direct message and read each friend's latest tweet.

## Project 2: Command Line Web Server and Browser
### Spec
Create a browser and a server that will run in the command line.

The server should:
* Respond to GET and POST requests and yield the appropriate text

The browser should:
* Send a GET request and print the output.
* Send a POST request that asks for basic information, printing the output that the server sends back.

## Project 3: Fibonacci Functions
### Spec
Create two functions that take an integer and return an array with that many fibonacci numbers. One should be implemented using an interator and the other should be a recursive function.

## Project 4: Merge Sort
### Spec
Create a function that takes an array and sorts its elements using merge sort.

## Project 5: Binary Search Tree
### Spec
Construct the classes and methods necessary to make a binary search tree. Add search functionality using the following methodologies:
* Iterative breadth-first search
* Iterative depth-first search
* Recursive depth-first search.

## Project 6: Knight's Travails
### Spec
Create a method that takes a starting and finishing position for a knight on a chess board. Use tree traversal methods to return an array that contains the shortest path (in knight moves) from the start to the finish. For instance, if the method is passed [2, 3] and [8, 8], it should return [[2, 3], [4, 4], [6, 5], [8, 8]].

## Project 7: Time Traveling
### Spec
Create RSpec tests for various projects from days' past, making sure they all pass. Use the following projects to do this:
* "Caeser Cipher" from "Ruby Building Blocks"
* Six methods from "Enumerable Methods" in the "Advanced Building Blocks" assignment
* Victory conditions from the "Tic-Tac-Toe" project.

## Project 8: Connect Four
### Spec
Create a connect four game to be played in the command line. Use your newfound RSpec abilities to create tests for each object and method. That is, use TDD principles to build it, writing a failing test and coding to make the test pass, and then refactoring to improve it.
